- Data Cleaning : Remove duplicates, fix missing values, correct data types (e.g., date, numbers), and check for errors in Power BI or Excel.
- Data Modeling : Create relationships between different tables (like employee info, department, salary, etc.) using Power BI's Model view.
- Create KPIs using DAX formulas like : Total Employees = COUNT(EmployeeID)
- Attrition Rate = (No. of Employees Left / Total Employees) × 100
- Data Visualization : Use charts like bar charts, pie charts, cards, and line graphs to show key metrics like attrition, job satisfaction, salary trends, etc.
- Dashboard Design : Arrange visuals neatly, add slicers (filters) for gender, department, etc., and apply colors/icons to make the report easy to read.
- Analysis & Insight Generation : Study the charts to find trends and patterns, such as which job roles have higher attrition, or how distance from home affects employee retention.
